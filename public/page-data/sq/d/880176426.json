{"data":{"allStrapiRooms":{"nodes":[{"Category":"Press Release","Content":"**Feb, 2018** – Payall Payment Systems is a financial technology company on a mission to make bank-powered cross-border payments safe, instant, easy and modern while removing massive costs from the system. The company has pioneered a new banktech and regtech entity – a Cross-Border Processor for Banks to transform this high-risk, slow and difficult business and will feature global Correspondent Banking-as-a-Service. Seed capital of $1.5M has been received with commitments for an additional $1.0 M subject to achieving milestones. \n\nPayall will enable money to move globally at the speed of data through banks. The foundation for this is a compliance breakthrough that ensures foreign-initiated payments are safer than domestic payments. And, a payments and account management engine, called **SiGMAPP** (Single Shared Global Multicurrency Asset and Payments Platform), which was modeled after the single shared platforms of the US Fed Wire System and TARGET2 in Europe, that will power 24x7, Instant Global Payments in this $100 T market.     \n\nThe company will initially target four profiles of financial institutions. \n\n<br/> 1. Foreign Banks that have the **lost their ability to make domestic payments** through correspondent banks in the US or other countries  <br/>\n<br/> 2. Financial Institutions that have typically been **unable to offer cross-border payments** and want an easy and competitive cross-border product that’s turnkey from end-to-end  <br/>\n<br/> 3. Financial Institutions that have product expertise and can support API-based core system integrations, but want to **offer business payers and recipients greater choice and control**<br/>\n<br/> 4. Regional or Money Center Banks, or Specialty FIs with extensive foreign bank networks that provide correspondent support to cover and clear domestic/US payments but want to **overcome the opaque, high-risk realities of KYB**, source of funds and economic legitimacy of payments <br/>\n\nPayall was founded by **Gary Palmer**, **Chris Quinlan** and **Matt Van Meter**. \n\nGary was the co-founder of WildCard Systems – recognized as the pioneer in Visa™ and Mastercard™ prepaid cards (acquired by Efunds in 2005 and Efunds was acquired by FIS) by building the first-ever issuing processor for prepaid cards. He's served as a Vice-chair and Chairman of the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association (now <a href=\"https://www.ipa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ipa.org</a>) and was a director for the Center for Financial Service Innovations (now <a href=\"https://finhealthnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FinHealth Network</a>) for 10-years. More recently he was a co-founder and former Chairman of Adaptive Payments which Mastercard acquired in 2015 to become Mastercard Send. \n**Gary has committed substantial capital to the Seed Round.   ** \n\nThe family office of **Fred Hammer**, an icon in the banking industry for nearly 50 years, led the Seed Round. Fred has an illustrious banking career including an early start at Chase Manhattan. He was a previous director on the board of Visa International and was an investor or board member of many cutting-edge FinTech companies like Netspend and JetPay.\n  \nAlso making a substantial investment in the Seed Round is the **Finn Family Office**, led by David Finn.

Moreover, the company has pioneered a compliance breakthrough called **Click-for-KYB™** that delivers authenticated, KYB, source of funds and economic legitimacy of payments such that foreign-initiated payments are safer than domestic payments.\n\nPayall’s platform has taken inspiration from the *US Fed Wire* system and the *TARGET2* in Europe. However, there are material payment handling differences including that the platform is multi-currency, asset label indifferent and liquidity and foreign exchange are managed in a novel way. It also includes a robust suite of microservices required to support a diverse, global client base of financial institutions.  Additionally, **SiGMAPP** includes a modern, mobile-forward, core-like transaction account system for banks and their clients who are making and receiving payments as well as currency and other traders. It enables all participants to control and move their funds in ways that aren’t available through core bank systems or other FinTech companies. Bottom-line is that financial institutions can empower business customers to **Pay Anyone, Anywhere™** instantly, 24x7 and offer recipients unmatched control over their money.\n\nWhile **SiGMAPP** was inspired by trusted and familiar architecture known as a single shared platform, it’s designed to seamlessly bridge to new technologies and currencies. Specifically, the asset labeling construct supports any currency or asset designation including cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies. Also, the design of **SiGMAPP**’s microservices ensures that they’re interoperable with blockchain and DLT.  Moreover, planned use cases for blockchain include supply chain management, fully off-line (no WiFi, no power) payment ecosystems and specialized identification applications in public as well as private permissioned networks and hybrids.\n\n**SiGMAPP** operates external to a bank’s core but is perpetually balanced and leverages common core system protocols and local payment infrastructure to minimize bank project or technology work. The platform includes proprietary software as well as leverages emerging and traditional domestic connections for last-mile payment options. **SiGMAPP** has been developed in a way that allows separate platform components to be launched incrementally, as standalone domestic services, in a foreign country, or on a global scale. \n\n<i style=\"font-size: 13px\">Payall is a new type of  banktech and regtech entity, the first-ever Cross-Border Bank Processor that enables money to move globally at the speed of data through banks. The company has pioneered a new paradigm of global correspondent banking-as-a-service. Proprietary software and processes overcome the high-risk nature of cross-border payments such that foreign-initiated payments are safer than domestic payments.

Still, with unaddressed underlying issues, ranging from desperate demand paired with an inability to easily and safely identify certified, high quality suppliers, lack of trading capabilities and transparency all the way to limited inter-country cooperation – it all paints an industry in pain.  \n \nThe Civil Defense Marketplace’s main goal will be to match those looking for Civil Defense Products and Services with those who sell them. This is a cumbersome service that has been done manually, wasting thousands of human hours, not scalable, nor ideal. This is especially true amid the current crisis, when countries are in desperate need of a method to quickly identify, connect to and engage with trusted, and verified suppliers and buyers, streamline payments and shipments. \n\nThe **first ever** digital Civil Defense Marketplace will offer unique, desirable features for both sellers and buyers alike:  \n\n- Robust compliance and certification capabilities \n- Ultimate, secure, multi-currency and international cross-country payments \n- 3rd party inspections \n- Cloud based inventory management  \n- Logistics & insurance support \n- Bank grade due diligence on buyers and sellers \n- Authentication of product certification \n- Support of Civil Defense specific products & services \n- Commercial bid administration \n- Escrow administration \n- Integrated trade finance \n- Digital marketing platform \n- Supply chain traceability \n- Security payments transactions \n- Global Pay-In & Pay-Out: Wire transfer, Crypto, Cards\n\nThe Marketplace will welcome companies that sell and buy in the civil defense area, as well as non-profits that aid civil defense initiatives, as well as volunteers and other professionals who offer their services to support our global humanitarian community. If you are interested in discovering the marketplace, check it out here. \n\nPayall attributes its selection to the company’s ability to quickly & efficiently integrate industry-specific needs for product certifications, logistics, trade finance, and shifting of product purchases from a seller receipt to dynamic buyer-controlled cloud-based inventory management. The MVP is scheduled to launch Q1 2021, gradually expanding capabilities to an existing pipeline of over 80 suppliers and buyers.  \n\nThe goal is to have the platform grant access only to reliable players, all of which will have payment accounts on the system. Accounts that are going to be paired with secure payment capabilities with instant cross-border transactions and capabilities around card acceptance, and crypto, offering buyer protection, and multiple value-added services. Besides that, the company will set to combat some of the global challenges that plague this industry segment, the likes of fragmented supply chains, lack of real-time transparency, lack of quality control, risk of high trading volume, lack of trading capability, and a high risk of bad players involvement. \n\nWith over 30 years of experience, the International Civil Defense Support & Coordination Agency (ICDSCA) has the purpose to cover cooperation gaps between National Civil Defense & Protection International Organizations and different NGOs. It identifies technologies, goods, knowledge, and services useful for saving human lives or protecting the environment around the world and makes them available to the National Civil Defense & Protection bodies and international & regional organizations.  \n\n<i style=\"font-size: 13px\">Payall is a new type of  banktech and regtech entity, the first-ever Cross-Border Bank Processor that enables money to move globally at the speed of data through banks. The company has pioneered a new paradigm of global correspondent banking-as-a-service. Proprietary software and processes overcome the high-risk nature of cross-border payments such that foreign-initiated payments are safer than domestic payments.

Independent Banker is making the case that things may be changing, in an article titled <a href=\"https://independentbanker.org/2021/02/why-it-pays-to-offer-cross-border-payments/\" target=\"_blank\">“Why it pays to offer cross-border payments”</a>, quoting Payall Founder & CEO, **Gary Palmer**. \n\nThe market’s rapid growth is attributed to small and medium sized businesses offering and purchasing goods on a global scale. Industry studies indicate that 60% of U.S. small and medium businesses already participate in foreign trade, with another 18% planning to, in the near future.  \n \nA SWIFT survey of corporate treasurers revealed that 55% have no plans to use alternative providers to their current banks to make cross-border payments. This might just be the opening for community banks to make their entrance into the market. \n\nHowever, it’s difficult for community banks to open the tap on this revenue stream. *“Community banks are challenged to offer cross-border payments, because in a traditional model, they can really only be justified by substantial volume … Historically, there has been no such thing as a ‘cross-border payment process’ powering a bank product, but that is changing in today’s landscape”*, states Gary Palmer as the reason. \n \nThe change Gary Palmer mentions comes with Payall’s **Single shared Global Multicurrency Asset and Payments Platform (SiGMAPP)**, designed to specifically enable banks to offer safe, fast and compliant cross-border payments, through a turn-key, end-to-end product. \n\nWith a breakthrough in compliance, “new rails” that require no change to a bank’s core and unprecedent recipient options, Payall delivers 24x7 instant global payments, safely, with an up to 90% reduction in cost and satisfaction on all ends.  \n \nPress Releases: \n- <a href=\"https://payallps.com/newsroom/payall_payment_systems_announces_SiGMAPP_alpha_release\" target=\"_blank\">Payall Payment Systems Announces SiGMAPP Alpha Release</a>\n- <a href=\"https://payallps.com/newsroom/payall_payment_systems_closes_seed_round\" target=\"_blank\">Payall Payment Systems Closes Seed Round</a>\n","Title":"Cross-Border Payments: An Untapped Revenue Stream for Community Banks","Author":{"Name":"Payall","Avatar":{"url":"/uploads/White_Logo_on_Blue_BG_d048a3049b_14db4b37e5.webp"}},"strapiId":13,"image":null,"Short_description":"Cross-Border Payments have a significant revenue potential for community banks, yet they stay untapped as they face multiple challenges in offering this to the business customers.

Before we get started let’s agree on a definition of FinTech:\n\n*“FinТech firms, those that apply technological innovation to financial functions and systems...”*\n\n **Patrick T. Harker**, “Philadelphia Fed's Harker: Regulation Is Key to Safeguarding Fintech, Consumers”\n\nThis article explains the arcane innards of FinTech and an alternative paradigm for accelerating product development and reducing cash requirements by thinking about banks, technology and people in a fundamentally different manner.\n\nMy thinking around FinTech is organized by three broad vertical markets or user profiles — **Business, Government and Consumer**.\n\n![g1_1_2x_0fcd717801](/uploads/g1_1_2x_0fcd717801_bb9c8ff945.webp)\n\nThere are numerous examples of FinTech products. Some are quite mature, such as Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) for the delivery of social benefits while more recent examples include cryptocurrencies, blockchain applications and mobile payments.\n\nFinTech applications vary and are supposed to be better than the existing proposition from the perspective of user accessibility, cost, speed, ease of use, control, integration with non-payment applications or safety. \n\n<h3>But most new FinTech companies fail</h3>\n\nMany FinTech companies failed over the last 20 years. Some products failed to solve problems or add better value, some were difficult to acquire or complicated to use; Others killed-off by regulators; Many burned through their budget before they even earned enough revenue to cover costs. \n\nThe approach I describe enables FinTech visionaries to minimize cash requirements, shrink development timelines and even come close to the impossible — flipping the classic FinTech business model from a high fixed cost to a variable cost model. \n\n**Every FinTech product must have a Regulated Entity, Technology and People to exist**. \n\n\n<h3>I call this the FinTech Triad.</h3>\n\n![g2_1_2x_1d63e4bd0c](/uploads/g2_1_2x_1d63e4bd0c_6338873d15.webp)\n\n\n<h2>Regulated Entities</h2>\n\n![g3_36dcb58530](/uploads/g3_36dcb58530_4524d81296.webp)\n\nDeposit Institutions, Acquirers, Issuers, Consumer Lenders, Commercial Lenders, ACH Operators and more. \n\nThe “official name” and service provided by each Regulated Entity varies by jurisdiction. State Banks, Federal Banks, Credit Unions, non-bank entities such as eMoney Issuers and Payment Institutions are all regulated for specific payment services. \n\nIn order to understand the importance of Regulated Entities, let's examine the case of Bitcoin: Bitcoin is often cited as the prime example of FinTech gone bad since, according to many, Bitcoin operates “entirely outside the financial system.” \n\nIn fact, all funds that flow into Bitcoin come from a “source”, and that source is always a bank — either by money transfer or a credit/debit card transaction. \n\nThis means that a Regulated Entity — a deposit bank, a credit card issuer, or a debit card issuer - plays an essential role enabling the funding of an account to purchase cryptocurrency. Without Regulated Entities completing due diligence on these customers. Moreover, it also authorized or approved the transaction to fund the account used to buy Bitcoin. \n\nWhen Bitcoin is converted to fiat, funds are transferred into an account at a Regulated Entity. It’s clear that Regulated Entities are essential for Bitcoin to exist. \n\n**Again, all FinTech, even crypto products, depend on Regulated Entities.**\n\nFinTech operators should consider an alternative and far more effective approach, which involves engaging a specialized Regulated Entity. \n\nIn the US, a leading prepaid issuer is Meta Bank. For 15+ years, Brad Hanson, CEO of Meta Payment Systems, has built a highly focused, efficient and innovative prepaid business. He powers hundreds of prepaid programs and numerous program managers. This is an example of specialization by a Regulated Entity that works to provide quality services within a specific need. \n\nFinTech operators should select a bank based on the specific services needed instead of convenience. When choosing to partner with Regulated Entities based on needs instead of convenience, it becomes an open, constructive process rather than a stifling relationship. Specialty services available from Regulated Entities include payment card acquiring, ACH origination, prepaid issuing, core banking services, consumer or business lending, and other. \n\nRespecting Regulated Entities and engaging them as valuable partners ensures the existence of a strong (yet progressive) compliance foundation on which to build the FinTech business and operate. \n\n**Working with a Regulated Entity is a requirement - they’re invaluable partners and are often the “ticket” required to be in FinTech!**\n\n\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n\n![g4](/uploads/g4_10ec44c9f7.png)\n\nCore Systems, Acquirer Processors, Issuer Processors, ACH Originators and more. \n\nFew FinTech solutions are technically revolutionary. The technical differentiator that powered the success of PayPal, Square, BillMatrix, Evolution1, Eccount and even WildCard Systems (a prepaid processing company I co-founded) and many other current and previous notable FinTech companies is how these businesses enveloped or repurposed existing technology, and then just added their own “special sauce” to solve the big problems. It is about the efficiency of getting the unique product to the market – not about developing technology from scratch. \n\nTransCard is an example of a technology firm that a FinTech business can build around with their “special sauce”. While broadly categorized as an issuing processor of network branded prepaid cards, their capabilities are more akin to a specialized corporate disbursements engine that features a robust data processing microservice prior to reaching the prepaid issuing platform. This enables payers of all sorts (from medical or pharmaceutical to entertainment platforms) who require enhanced decisioning based on a set of rules, to leverage the TransCard service rather than build their own from scratch. \n\nIf existing capabilities aren’t sufficient, FinTech companies face a choice to either a) build additional tools or b) engage companies like TransCard to incrementally extend their service. Generally, the latter is much faster, cheaper and more efficient than an external build. \n\nOnce systems are constructed, the ongoing care-and-feeding for the product begins. From funding a data center and perpetual PCI-compliance to ongoing network administration, software support and technical operations, quarterly updates from the likes of Visa and Mastercard... Data centers. Hardware. Software. People. The high-cost nature of this approach sucks cash - fast. It’s difficult to balance devoting energy to both the processes of keeping the product running and attracting customers in order to maintain sales. \n\n**What’s the alternative?**\n\nFiguring out how to integrate with or wrap-around a payment technology provider is much better than building everything from scratch. There are several capable processors, software companies and core system providers that can make ideal partners. \n\nJust as with Regulated Entities, the big-payment and banking technology companies can also be sales channels and, eventually, buyers of the FinTech business. \n\n![g5](/uploads/g5_a435431044.png)\n\n<h3>Which sounds more appealing?</h3>\n\n**Paying a technology partner a penny per transaction, a modest subscription or license fee, versus spending millions (or tens of millions) of dollars and wasting months or years building readily available services?** \n\n\n\n<h2>People</h2>\n\n![g6_47f7e2f7e2](/uploads/g6_47f7e2f7e2_51ed6bdf8c.webp)\n\nDevelopers, KYC/ AML, Compliance Experts, Product Managers, User Support and more \n\nAt a high-level, I’ve dissected People into 3-types: Development, Operations and Sales. To be clear, these are highly specialized for FinTech, but with the ability to broadly apply financial concepts to new applications. \n\nWhat if there was a way to leverage a single company for a wider set of core people functions necessary to support the development of “special sauce” and the entire FinTech people operations? \n\nWhen we dissect “what people do” or “what people services are needed”, clear repetition and overlaps emerge. Some companies already tackled this overlap by creating “FinTech people platforms” consisting of an entire team of professional FinTech-specialized services. \n\nSome of them offer services on a subscription basis, which can replace the typical high fixed payroll cost for a core team with a variable cost structure. This saves cash — not to mention a lot of management calories to identify, recruit, hire, train, manage and keep motivated an oftentimes underutilized and expensive team. \n\n\n\n<h2>Closing Comments</h2>\n\nThere’s no panacea. By thinking along the dimensions of the FinTech Triad (Regulated Entities, Technology and People), critically analyze what needs to be developed and what a partner could provide. Carefully selecting the right partner allows FinTech products to launch faster, cheaper and easier than the alternative of building, hiring and managing everything in-house. \n\nA jack-of-all-trades is a master of none when it comes to building an efficient and successful FinTech operation that makes it to market quickly. Instead of trying to stretch time, energy and capital thinly across all the necessities of creating and maintaining a FinTech product, delegating areas of the process to well-equipped partners allows the product to come alive quicker and thrive. \n\n\n*This is an excerpt from a White Paper published by Gary Palmer in March 2019.  \nRead and download the full version <a href=\"https://payall.com/The_best_way_to_get_your_Fin_Tech_idea_to_market.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.*\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://payall.com/The_best_way_to_get_your_Fin_Tech_idea_to_market.pdf\">![Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12_22_38_PM_22aee10521](/uploads/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12_22_38_PM_22aee10521_ea32c0079e.webp)</a>","Title":"The Best Way to Get Your FinTech Idea to Market","Author":{"Name":"Gary Palmer","Avatar":{"url":"/uploads/g00_591cd544d3_af1900f336.webp"}},"strapiId":14,"image":{"url":"/uploads/Newsroom_989d615f76_675ec426cf.webp"},"Short_description":"Exploring the arcane innards of FinTech and providing an alternative paradigm for accelerating product development and reducing cash requirements by thinking about banks, technology and people in a fundamentally different manner.","url":"get-your-fintech-idea-to-market","Posted_date":"2019-12-11T10:00:00.000Z"},{"Category":"In the Press","Content":"\n\"Gary Palmer is no stranger to the world of banking innovation. The serial entrepreneur has been building software for the finance world for more than 20 years.\", starts the Miami Herald company profile.\n\n**[Fintech veteran solves big banking problem: how to securely send money around the globe](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/business-plan-challenge/article251351228.html)**\n\nIn the late 1990s, the fintech pioneer co-founded WildCard Systems, credited with inventing prepaid Visa cards and Mastercards. That company sold for more than a quarter of a billion dollars in 2005 and its acquirer, Efunds, was purchased by the publicly traded FIS for $1.8 billions in 2007. Palmer continued on with FIS for a couple of years. He went on to found and chair Adaptive Payments, which sold to Mastercard in 2015, as well as invest in other banking technology companies. \n\n“I’m the most boring guy at cocktail parties because all I talk about are bank technologies, payment processing, FinTech regulations, risk mitigation, all that stuff”, he said. \n\nWhile investing in a couple of companies in Europe, he realized that it was a nightmare transferring money abroad — “just a complete disaster”. So in 2018, he decided to bring the band back together to go after this particular problem. \n\n“We fix cross border payments through banks. This is a big idea, and we know how to execute”, says Palmer, founder and CEO of Payall, the winner of the 2021 Miami Herald Pitch Competition.\n\n \n![MIA_STARTUPPITCHWINNER-PAYALL-Local0127JAI](/uploads/MIA_STARTUPPITCHWINNER_PAYALL_Local0127_JAI_7eba8713c5.jpeg)\n\nThe article also touches on the company leadership. \"His experienced team includes many executives he has worked with before. That includes his chief technology officer, Chuck Hutchison, who helped design and build Zelle; and his head of operations, Shelly Schneekloth, who was previously, chief operating officer of MetaBank, a leading U.S. fintech bank\". “We have experienced folks who know how to tackle this big idea.”\n \nHere’s the problem: cross-border payments are expensive because they are largely a manual process; in a world where cybersecurity and money-laundering risks are high, such payments are also risky. Payall uses AI technology to make the system more efficient and less costly, as well as safe and secure. It partners with banks rather than compete with them and offers a turn-key solution. \n\n“The current process is broken, and we are results oriented”, Palmer said. \n\n“For the first time ever”, he said, “a bank in the U.S. that is clearing a payment initiated abroad can see the source of funds, the economic legitimacy of the payment, and the owners of the business making it; this is a breakthrough. We are the first-ever global single-shared platform for moving data and money around the world. We get the money delivered in minutes or seconds — versus days — and we do it safely.” \n\nPayall’s products also support unbanked consumers through a mobile wallet solution or prepaid card. \n\n**Read more on the Miami Herald [website](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/business-plan-challenge/article251351228.html).** \n\n*Payall is a new type of  banktech and regtech entity, the first-ever Cross-Border Bank Processor that enables money to move globally at the speed of data through banks. The company has pioneered a new paradigm of global correspondent banking-as-a-service.  Proprietary software and processes overcome the high-risk nature of cross-border payments such, that foreign-initiated payments are safer than domestic payments.
